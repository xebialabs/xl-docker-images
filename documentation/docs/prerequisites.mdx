# Prerequisites

## Setup virtualenv

If you want to generate Dockerfiles for new versions of the DevOps platform, or build a container out of them using the script provided, you need to setup your Python environment.
To make this easy we've provided a `Pipfile` that contains the necessary dependencies for the Python build scripts. To install these, you can use the link: [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) command line tool.

You can install this on Mac using Brew:

```shell
$ brew install pipenv
```

Or you can install this using regular Python pip:

```shell
$ pip install --user pipenv
```

After you've installed `pipenv` just execute:

```shell
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```

This will install all the dependencies and activate the `virtualenv` containing all the installed dependencies.
