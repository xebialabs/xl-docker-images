Applejack loves to help you generate Dockerfiles for the XebiaLabs DevOps Platform. She is also able to commit them to version control or create the Docker images from whatever she generates. You just have to feed her a Python environment.

## Setup virtualenv

If you want to generate Dockerfiles for new versions of the DevOps platform, or build a container out of them using the script provided, you need to setup your Python environment.
To make this easy we've provided a `Pipfile` that contains the necessary dependencies for the Python build scripts. To install these, you can use the link: [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) command line tool.

You can install this on Mac using Brew:

```shell
$ brew install pipenv
```

Or you can install this using regular Python pip:

```shell
$ pip install --user pipenv
```

After you've installed `pipenv` just execute:

```shell
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```

This will install all the dependencies and activate the `virtualenv` containing all the installed dependencies.
